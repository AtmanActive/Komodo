Komodo Edit Tab Sorting Macros
======

Macros and other code snippets for enhancing Komodo Edit functionality

- Tabs_Sort_by_Name.js - Sort open tabs by name (already in the core functionality)
- Tabs_Sort_by_Extension_then_Filename.js - Sort open tabs by name but grouping by extension
- Tabs_Sort_by_Path.js - Sort open tabs by path

How to use:
Download or copy-paste these files, change their extension to '.komodotool' and then put them in your Komodo/.../tools/ folder. 
After starting or restarting your Komodo Edit/IDE, they should appear under Toolbox Panel 
( View -> Tabs & Sidebars -> Toolbox ). 
From there you can setup keyboard shortcuts and other properties by right-clicking on a macro and choosing 'Properties'.
